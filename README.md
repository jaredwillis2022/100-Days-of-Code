Here I go. I’ve been a teacher for 19 years and am ready for a new adventure.
I’m making a mid-career change to coding. My goals are to study predictive
analytics and machine learning. Python seems like the reasonable best place to
start. But, I’m going to start with Java.
</p>
<p>
I spent close to two weeks with Bloomtech, but didn’t feel that the boot camp
route was right for me. So here we go!
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Started with Beginning Programming for Dummies</em></strong>,
6th ed.
</li>

Continued studying with the book above.

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Started with Beginning Programming for Dummies</em></strong>,
6th ed.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Also, I got this book about building text adventures with Java. I chose this
book because when I was at BloomTech for 2 weeks, they were using something very
similar. I’m so glad I spent $10 bucks on this rather than go passed my free
trial and be on the hook for $40k.

<ol>
<li><strong><em>The Little Book of Java Adventure Game Programming: Learn Object
Oriented Programming–advanced coding techniques.</em></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Today I learned that Object-Oriented Programming can also be referred to as
Class-Oriented Programming.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Got the syntax down. {  and ;
<li>Methods have a Type, Name, and Parameter
<li>.In Object-Oriented Programming similar data can be grouped together and
separate from other data.

	Today I watched <strong>Bro Code</strong> code the Snake Game with Java. I
watched it at the youtube link below. I also followed along with IntelliJ. Only
made it halfway through the video.

<p>
Today I understood the difference between constructors and methods. They look
alike and have similar syntax, but constructors don’t return anything. They work
in the background to prepare the game for user input.

<p>
	Finished coding along with BroCode the Java Snake game.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The graphics take a lot of coding. It seems like more than the actual code
to run the game
<li>I could understand 80-90 percent of what he was doing. I finished the
repetitive things before he did.
<li>Still, there is so much to learn.
<li>Lots of For Loops. ( i, i > 0, i++)
</li>
</ul>
